<!-- HTML Template for the overview (default) state of the dashboard
The overview section should be comprised entirely of 'planels' which is very cleverly, 'plan' + 'elements'.<br><br>
The idea is that everything the user can see in the subsections of the dashboard (their net worth statement, budget analysis, favorited tutorials, etc.) are all enclosed in a planel directive that allows the user to customize their dashboard.<br><br>
The user can customize their dashboard in three ways:<br>
1. From any of the sub views, a user can click the '+' sign in the top right of a planel and it will be added to the overview.<br>
2. From the overview, a user may click 'Customize My Dashboard' to reorder these planels via drag-and-drop.<br>
2. From the overview, a user may click the small 'x' button on any given planel (revealed after they click 'Customize My Dashboard') to remove the respective planel from the overview.<br>
